# 📜 STRATEG CONSTITUTION v2.0

**The Immutable Framework Governing All MVCA Operations**

---

## 🏛️ Constitutional Authority

This directory contains the **supreme law** of the STRATEG ecosystem.

**Immutability Principle:**
> MVCA (Vibe Coding Companion) has **READ-ONLY** access to this directory.  
> Constitutional changes require human governance process.  
> No AI system may override constitutional mandates.

## 🔒 Constitutional Guarantees

### 1. Immutability
Once ratified, constitutional segments can only change through formal amendment process requiring:
- Human governance review
- Community feedback period (30 days)
- Supermajority approval (75%+)

### 2. Supremacy
Constitutional mandates override:
- User preferences (if they contradict security/quality)
- AI suggestions (if they violate principles)
- Market trends (if they compromise stability)
- Time pressure (if it risks quality)

### 3. Transparency
Every constitutional decision includes:
- Rationale (why this mandate exists)
- Evidence (research, case studies, expert consensus)
- Examples (how to apply in practice)
- Anti-patterns (what NOT to do)

## 📖 How MVCA Uses This Constitution

### Read-Only Access
```typescript
// MVCA can READ
const constitution = await github.fetch(
  "constitution/01-foundation-layer/07-article-vi-strategic-commandments.md"
)

// MVCA CANNOT write (enforced at repository level)
❌ await github.write("constitution/...", newContent) // BLOCKED
```

### Decision-Making Flow
```
User Input: "I need authentication"
      ↓
MVCA reads constitution/01-foundation-layer/07-article-vi-strategic-commandments.md
      ↓
Finds: "Commandment #3: Passwords MUST be hashed with bcrypt (12+ rounds)"
      ↓
Applies to prompt: "Hash passwords with bcrypt, cost factor 12"
      ↓
Validates against: OWASP Top 10, security best practices
      ↓
Generates constitutional prompt with security mandates
```

### Web Search Integration
```
User Input: "Use latest NextAuth.js"
      ↓
MVCA reads constitution (authentication principles)
      ↓
Searches web: "NextAuth.js latest version 2026"
      ↓
Finds: NextAuth.js v5.2.0 (released Jan 2026)
      ↓
Validates against constitutional mandates:
  ✓ Supports bcrypt password hashing
  ✓ HTTP-only cookie sessions
  ✓ CSRF protection
      ↓
Includes in prompt: "Use NextAuth.js v5.2.0 with..."
```

## 🎯 Constitutional Compliance Levels

| Level | Description | MVCA Behavior |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **MUST** | Absolute requirement | Will enforce (cannot be overridden) |
| **SHOULD** | Strong recommendation | Will include with explanation |
| **MAY** | Optional enhancement | Will suggest if beneficial |
| **MUST NOT** | Strictly forbidden | Will block and explain why |

**Example:**
```
Constitutional Mandate:
"Passwords MUST be hashed. bcrypt SHOULD use cost factor 12+. 
SHA-1 MUST NOT be used for passwords."

MVCA Enforcement:
✓ Will always hash passwords (MUST)
✓ Will recommend bcrypt cost 12+ (SHOULD)
✓ Will refuse SHA-1 for passwords (MUST NOT)
```

   - Template: Must include rationale, evidence, impact analysis

2. **Human Review**
   - PromptHeroStudio governance team reviews
   - Community comment period (30 days for constitutional changes)

3. **Decision**
   - Accepted → moves to `knowledge-base/` (if operational knowledge)
   - Accepted → constitutional amendment process (if fundamental principle)
   - Rejected → archived in `learning-log/rejected/` with explanation

4. **Constitutional Ratification** (for fundamental changes only)
   - Requires 75%+ governance approval
   - Versioned (e.g., Constitution v2.1.0)
   - Changelog maintained
