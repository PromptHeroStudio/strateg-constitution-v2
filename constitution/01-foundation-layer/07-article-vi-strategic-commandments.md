# ARTICLE VI: The 10 Strategic Commandments

## 📜 Constitutional Status: UNBREAKABLE RULES
These commandments are not suggestions—they are the operational DNA of every successful Vibe Coder. Violate them at your peril; embrace them for guaranteed success.

## ⚡ COMMANDMENT 1: THOU SHALT START SMALL

### **The Law of Minimum Viable Everything**
> Begin with the smallest possible version of everything: feature, test, deployment, team.

### **Operational Implementation**
- **MVP Maximum:** 3 features or less
- **Increment Maximum:** 2 hours implementation time
- **Deployment Minimum:** Deploy after first working feature
- **Team Principle:** Solo until forced to expand

### **Violation Symptoms**
- Planning for months without building
- Feature creep before MVP launch
- "Just one more thing" syndrome
- Over-engineering simple solutions

### **Constitutional Compliance Test**
Q: Can this be smaller?
A: If yes → make it smaller.
Q: Can this be tested sooner?
A: If yes → test it now.
Q: Can this be deployed faster?
A: If yes → deploy immediately.

## ⚡ COMMANDMENT 2: THOU SHALT PROVIDE CONTEXT

### **The Law of Contextual Supremacy**
> No prompt without context. No decision without framework. No code without understanding.

### **Operational Implementation**
- **Context Stacking Order:**
  1. Business Context (Why)
  2. Technical Context (How)
  3. User Context (Who)
  4. Constraint Context (Limits)
  5. Historical Context (What exists)

- **Context Documentation:** Every prompt includes context references
- **Context Validation:** AI must confirm understanding before proceeding

### **Violation Symptoms**
- AI producing irrelevant code
- Constant misunderstandings
- Repeating same explanations
- Features not aligning with goals

### **Constitutional Compliance Test**
Before each prompt, verify:
✅ Business context included
✅ Technical constraints specified
✅ User needs referenced
✅ Previous work considered
✅ Success criteria defined

  1. Immediate (30s visual check)
  2. Functional (5m basic testing)
  3. Integration (15m system testing)
  4. User (30m experience testing)

- **Validation Frequency:** After EVERY AI interaction
- **Validation Documentation:** Every validation documented

### **Violation Symptoms**
- Bugs discovered late
- "It worked on my machine"
- Users encountering errors
- Security vulnerabilities in production

### **Constitutional Compliance Test**
Can I deploy this RIGHT NOW?
If no → what validation is missing?
If yes → validate one more time anyway.

---

## ⚡ COMMANDMENT 4: THOU SHALT NOT COPY-PASTE BLINDLY

### **The Law of Conscious Integration**
> Every line of AI-generated code must be understood before integration.

### **Operational Implementation**
- **Code Review Protocol:**
  1. Read every line
  2. Understand its purpose
  3. Verify security implications
  4. Check performance impact
  5. Confirm alignment with goals

- **Learning Requirement:** Understand WHY code works, not just THAT it works
- **Documentation Mandate:** Document any code you don't fully understand

### **Violation Symptoms**
- Mysterious bugs
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Cannot explain own codebase

### **Constitutional Compliance Test**
For each code block:
Can I explain this to a junior developer?
Can I modify it without breaking?
Can I identify potential issues?
If any NO → study until YES.

## ⚡ COMMANDMENT 5: THOU SHALT THINK IN SYSTEMS

### **The Law of Holistic Development**
> No feature is an island. Every component exists within interconnected systems.

### **Operational Implementation**
- **System Mapping:** Document data flows, dependencies, integrations
- **Impact Analysis:** Before changes, analyze ripple effects
- **Architecture Validation:** Weekly system architecture review
- **Failure Mode Consideration:** Consider how each component can fail

### **Violation Symptoms**
- Integration nightmares
- Unexpected side effects
- Scalability issues
- Technical debt accumulation

### **Constitutional Compliance Test**
For each new component:
What systems does it touch?
What depends on it?
How does it fail?
Who is notified when it fails?

---

## ⚡ COMMANDMENT 6: THOU SHALT DOCUMENT AS YOU GO

### **The Law of Progressive Documentation**
> Documentation is not a final step—it's a continuous process.

### **Operational Implementation**
- **Documentation Minimum:**
  - Why (Purpose)
  - How (Implementation)
  - Where (Location)
  - Who (Ownership)
  - When (Timeline)

- **Documentation Triggers:**
  1. After each feature completion
  2. After each integration
  3. After each deployment
  4. After each error resolution

### **Violation Symptoms**
- Forgotten functionality
- Knowledge silos
- Onboarding difficulties
- Repeated mistakes

### **Constitutional Compliance Test**
If I disappeared today, could someone:

Continue development?

Fix bugs?

Deploy updates?

Understand business logic?
If any NO → document immediately.

## ⚡ COMMANDMENT 7: THOU SHALT EMBRACE ERRORS AS LESSONS

### **The Law of Constructive Failure**
> Every error contains valuable information. Extract it systematically.

### **Operational Implementation**
- **Error Protocol:**
  1. Capture (Screenshot/log)
  2. Analyze (Root cause)
  3. Document (Lessons learned)
  4. Prevent (System changes)
  5. Share (Team knowledge)

- **Error Celebration:** Document and share valuable errors
- **Error Prevention:** Use errors to improve processes

### **Violation Symptoms**
- Repeated same errors
- Blame culture
- Hidden failures
- Missed learning opportunities

### **Constitutional Compliance Test**
For each error:
What can we learn?
How can we prevent recurrence?
Who needs to know?
How does this improve our system?

## ⚡ COMMANDMENT 8: THOU SHALT KEEP HUMANS IN THE LOOP

### **The Law of Human Oversight**
> AI assists, humans decide. AI suggests, humans validate.

### **Operational Implementation**
- **Human Checkpoints:**
  1. Project direction
